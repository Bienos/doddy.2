# V3 status — Doddy in the Dynamic Island
Date: 2026-10-09. Owner request: "it opens app [with] double back tap, now live island". ADRs 053–054 in `DECISIONS.md`.

## What it does
- Start a conversation as before (Talk to Doddy, Double Back Tap, Action Button). You can now go Home or open another app: the conversation keeps running and Doddy appears in the **Dynamic Island** (and as a banner on the **Lock Screen**).
- Compact island: Doddy's head + a status symbol (waveform = listening, … = thinking, speaker = speaking, hand = confirm a note in the app, mic-slash = muted).
- Long-press the island (expanded): status, elapsed time, **Mute/Unmute** and **End**.
- Lock Screen: the same, on Doddy's cream background.
- Tap the island to jump back into the app (e.g. to Save or Don't save a note Doddy proposed).
- The island disappears the moment the conversation ends (End, Close, connection lost, failure). A stale one from a killed app is removed at the next launch.

## How
| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| Activity type + labels/symbols | `Shared/VoiceActivity/DoddyVoiceAttributes.swift` (app + extension) |
| Mute / End buttons | `Shared/VoiceActivity/VoiceActivityIntents.swift`: `LiveActivityIntent`s; the app registers handlers in `VoiceSessionController.start` |
| Island + Lock Screen UI | `DoddyWidgets/` widget extension (new target `com.bienos.doddy2.dev.widgets`); head image rendered from the v1.3-r1 waving SVGs |
| Start / update / end | `DoddyApp/Features/Voice/VoiceLiveActivity.swift`, driven by `didSet` on phase, mute and pending save in `VoiceSessionController` |
| Background audio + Live Activities | `Config/Doddy-Info.plist` (`UIBackgroundModes: audio`, `NSSupportsLiveActivities`) |
| Keep running in background | `VoiceView` no longer ends the conversation on `scenePhase == .background` |

## Verified
Linux only: capability guard passes (now also scans `DoddyWidgets/`, `Shared/`, `Config/`); plists and asset JSON parse. **Nothing compiled** (no Swift/Xcode in this environment; ActivityKit/WidgetKit are Apple-only).

## To check on the iPhone
1. Build: `git pull && make project`, then set **Team** for **both** targets, `Doddy` and `DoddyWidgets` (Signing & Capabilities).
2. Start a conversation, press Home: island shows Doddy; talk — status changes listening → thinking → speaking.
3. Keep talking from another app for 2+ minutes (reports exist of iOS killing background recording after ~50 s).
4. Long-press island → Mute (status "Muted", Doddy can't hear you) → Unmute → End (island disappears, app shows "Conversation ended").
5. From another app ask "remember that my locker code is 1234": island shows the hand / "Confirm in Doddy"; tap it, Save.
6. Lock the phone mid-conversation: Lock Screen banner with Mute/End.
7. Settings → Doddy → Live Activities off: conversation still continues in the background, no island.
