# Mac and iPhone verification checklist (branch `claude/brave-wright-k4jnu3`)

Date: 2026-10-10. Everything below was written and tested only on Linux (`scripts/ci.sh --core-only`,
268 Swift package tests, gateway and backend tests). **None of the app code has been compiled with Xcode or
run on a device.** Nothing here is verified until a person ticks it. Record the Xcode version, the device
and the result for each item in the table at the end.

## 0. What is already compiled
Since ADR-200, `scripts/typecheck_app_logic.sh` compiles eight non-UI app files (`MemoryStore`,
`ShortcutRouter`, `ProfileStore`, `ConversationLogStore`, `AskController`, `PersonalityPreferences`,
`PinnedNotesStorage`, `NoteReminderStore`) against the real DoddyCore module on Linux, and they pass. Everything else in
the app (SwiftUI views, the App Intents, the widget control, anything using UIKit, AVFoundation or
EventKit, and `PlaceLocation`, which the check replaces with a stub) has still never been compiled.

## 1. Build first
1. `xcodegen generate`, then `scripts/ci.sh` (the full run, not `--core-only`). Note the output.
2. If the app does not compile, these are the places most likely to need a one-line fix:
   - `DoddyApp/Intents/SaveToDoddyIntent.swift` and `FindInDoddyIntent.swift`: the `@Parameter(...)` arguments and `parameterSummary`.
   - `DoddyApp/Features/Memories/MemoriesView.swift`: `ForEach(choices, id: \.category)` over a tuple array; `let` statements inside the `ForEach` closure; `&pinnedRaw` passed inout inside a `Button` closure.
   - `DoddyApp/Features/Capture/CaptureView.swift`: `PasteButton` mutating `@State` in its `onPaste` closure. If Swift 6 calls it a Sendable-closure error, wrap the body in `MainActor.assumeIsolated { ... }`.
   - `VoiceView.swift` and `MemoryDetailView.swift`: `Picker(selection: Binding(get:set:))` that touches a main-actor object in `set`. Same pattern already builds in SettingsView; if it errors, make the closure `@MainActor`.
   - `DoddyApp/Features/Memories/MemoryDetailView.swift`: `PinnedNotes.toggle(_, stored: &pinnedRaw, ...)` on an `@AppStorage` property.
   - `DoddyApp/Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift`: `.fileImporter`, the `ProxyRepresentation` in `ProfileTextExport`, the two `confirmationDialog(... presenting:)` calls.
   - `DoddyApp/App/RootView.swift`: `$router.shownDraft` (a computed get/set on an `@Observable` class), `onChange(of:initial:)`.
   - `DoddyWidgets/NewNoteControl.swift` and `DoddyApp/Intents/DoddyShortcuts.swift` (four App Shortcuts).
3. Run the unit and UI tests. The existing UI tests save one note per run in an empty store, so the duplicate warning should not change them.

## 2. Memories
| # | Do this | Expect |
|---|---|---|
| M1 | Save "Gate code 4821". Save "gate  CODE 4821." again | "You saved this already" with the date, "View the saved note" and "Save it again anyway". Editing the text clears it (ADR-184) |
| M2 | Save notes of two or more types | A chip row (All, then each type with a count) above the list. Tapping a chip filters; tapping it again clears it (ADR-182) |
| M3 | Menu at the right of "YOUR SAVED NOTES" | Newest first, Oldest first, Recently changed. The choice is remembered after a relaunch (ADR-186) |
| M4 | Open a note → Pin to the top | A pin icon on its card and it moves to the top. An 11th pin shows "You can pin up to 10 notes". Deleting everything clears the pins (ADR-187) |
| M5 | Press and hold a card | Pin/Unpin, Copy text, Share text (ADR-188) |
| M6 | Note screen → Share text | The share sheet holds only the note's current words (ADR-185) |
| M7 | Delete one note | A "Note deleted. Undo" bar for about 10 seconds. Undo brings back the same text, corrections and dates. "Delete all" shows no bar (ADR-183) |
| M8 | Search for something with two notes that give different numbers | A "may disagree" banner and labels (ADR-171) |
| M9 | Copy some text elsewhere, open the capture screen, tap Paste | No permission prompt. The text goes in exactly as copied, replacing a blank editor or going on a new line after existing text. Nothing is saved until Save (ADR-189) |
| M10 | Open a voice-saved or "Other" note → Type menu → pick "Place" | The type changes at once and the type filter chips update. The text, dates and "Edited" label stay as they were (ADR-192) |
| M11 | Search for a word used by notes of two or more types | The same chips above the matches. A chip narrows them and says "Showing N of M matches". The "may disagree" banner still counts every match (ADR-199) |
| M12 | Correct one note three times (A → B → C → D), then open it | "Earlier versions (2)" lists C then B, each with its time. "Original capture" shows A. Relaunch: the same. Delete and Undo: the same. Search for a word only in B: no match (ADR-214) |
| M13 | Search "netflix password" with a wifi password note saved; then ask the same by voice | Find: "1 PARTIAL MATCH" and "No saved note mentions “netflix”…" above the wifi note. Voice: Doddy says no note mentions Netflix and does not read the wifi password out as the answer (ADR-213) |

## 2b. Accessibility (PRD item 7, acceptance test A-13)
| # | Do this | Expect |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | iOS Settings → Accessibility → Motion → Reduce Motion on. Run a voice conversation and the Ask screen; step through first-use onboarding | Scrolling to new messages and the onboarding steps are instant, not animated (ADR-201) |
| A2 | Largest Dynamic Type and VoiceOver on the new screens: type chips, sort menu, pin, undo bar, duplicate warning, remembered conversations | Everything reachable and readable; chips announce "Place, 2 notes" and "selected"; no clipped text |

## 3. Export, restore and settings
| # | Do this | Expect |
|---|---|---|
| E1 | Settings → About you → Export with your settings (JSON and text) | A file with the profile answers and voice/personality choices. Change a voice setting, return and export as text again: the new value is included (ADR-176) |
| E2 | Export memories as JSON, delete one note, then Restore from a JSON export and pick the file | A preview with counts, then "Added 1 note". Notes already on the phone are not replaced (ADR-178) |
| E3 | Restore a text file, an empty file and a hand-edited file with one note broken | A plain message each time and nothing added |
| E4 | Settings → What Doddy knows → Remembered conversations | The list, a full conversation, "Brought up next time" marks, delete one with confirmation, export as text (ADR-177). Delete from inside a conversation: it goes back one screen, not two |
| E5 | Settings → Your memories → Export as Markdown, then open the file in Notes or Files | A file named doddy-memories.md (check it is not .md.txt) with one heading per note, the words in a block quote, and the original for a corrected note (ADR-203) |
| E6 | With the M12 note: export as JSON, text and Markdown; delete everything; restore the JSON | Each file has B and C as earlier wordings. After restore the note shows "Earlier versions (2)" again (ADR-214) |

## 4. Shortcuts, Siri and controls
| # | Do this | Expect |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | Shortcuts app → Doddy → Save to Doddy, with some text | Doddy opens on the capture screen with the text filled in. Nothing is saved until Save (ADR-179) |
| S2 | Say "Save a note in Doddy" | Siri asks "What should Doddy keep?" |
| S3 | Add the New note control to Control Center and the Lock Screen, then press it | Empty capture screen (ADR-180) |
| S4 | "Find in Doddy" with the app **closed**, then open | Memories → Find with the words filled in and the results showing (ADR-181). Run it again with the app open |
| S5 | Start Save to Doddy while a voice conversation is open | The note appears after the conversation closes |
| S6 | Run Save to Doddy during first-use onboarding or while the Back Tap setup sheet is open | It waits and appears afterwards. A later Save to Doddy still works (it must not stay blocked) |

## 4b. The opening and listening on open (ADR-210)
| # | Do this | Expect |
|---|---|---|
| O1 | Launch the app (onboarding done) | About 2.4 s: a pen draws Doddy, two bounces with dust, crouch, spring, shot with a trail, SWISH! with confetti and a shake, he pops up, then jumps into his place on Home as Home fades in and the buttons slide in. **Main check: when the opening ends, Home's Doddy must not move by even a point** (light, dark, smallest and largest iPhone, largest text size where Home's picture is 100 pt). Also: every stroke of the pen drawing appears; no text greeting anywhere. `design/opening-v0.1/index.html` shows the intended timing |
| O2 | Settings → Voice → "Start listening when I open Doddy" off; relaunch and tap during the scene | It jumps to the hand-over: Doddy hops into his place and Home is usable within half a second. Nothing listens |
| O3 | Switch to another app and back within a minute; then leave it in the background for 5 minutes and come back | No scene on the quick return; the scene on the return after 5 minutes |
| O4 | Settings → Appearance → "Doddy's opening" off; relaunch | Home straight away. On again: the scene is back on the next launch |
| O6 | iOS Settings → Accessibility → Motion → Reduce Motion on; relaunch | A still picture: Doddy already in his place on Home, then the paper fades around him in about a second; nothing moves; Home's buttons are there at once. VoiceOver on: no opening |
| O7 | "Hide character artwork" on; relaunch | No scene |
| O8 | Fresh install, finish onboarding, then relaunch ("Start listening when I open Doddy" is on by default) | After the scene, Talk to Doddy opens by itself: the iOS microphone prompt the first time, then "Connecting…" and "Listening" from the real session, the orange indicator, Doddy's own first message spoken by the agent. End it. Privacy row reads "Only while talking. A conversation starts when you open Doddy; turn that off under Voice" |
| O9 | With O8 on: open Doddy from Back Tap or the Talk to Doddy control during the scene | The scene stops; one conversation, not two |
| O10 | With O8 on: iOS Settings → Doddy → Microphone off; relaunch | The scene plays; no conversation opens by itself (it would only say "Microphone is off"). Tapping Talk to Doddy still explains and offers Open Settings |
| O11 | With O8 on: tap a note reminder's "Done" from the Lock Screen (a background launch), then open Doddy | Nothing listened in the background; the scene (and the conversation) only once the app is on screen |

## 5. Voice (needs a real conversation)
| # | Do this | Expect |
|---|---|---|
| V1 | Settings → Voice and personality: play each voice sample, change speed and expressiveness | Samples play at the chosen speed. They refuse to play during a conversation (ADR-105, ADR-122) |
| V2 | Start a conversation with a non-default voice, speed and starting language | The voice and language are used. The dev agent allows the overrides. If it connects but sounds default, check the agent's override switches |
| V3 | Set a nickname | Doddy uses it now and then (ADR-127) |
| V4 | Turn on Private on the Talk screen, talk, end | The banner shows. The conversation is not in Remembered conversations (ADR-170) |
| V5 | Island: start a conversation, tap Mute and Unmute on the Live Activity | The Unmute fix works and the app keeps running (ADR-128; `NATIVE_BASELINE_REPORT.md`) |
| V6 | Reminders by voice (ADR-126, `M4_REMINDERS_STATUS.md`) | The device checks listed there |
| V7 | Ask Doddy to save a note by voice, pick "Place" on the card, tap Save | The note is saved with that type (see the type filter chips). Declining and a second proposal start at "Other" again (ADR-202) |

## 6. Ask and server
- Ask: after the daily limit is reached, "Try again" is hidden. This needs a deployed gateway with limits set (ADR-124, ADR-125). The Redis store and real OpenAI prices are still owner tasks.
